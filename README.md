# FinalProject17
You are a spelunker. You are in a cave, with three openings. They both look mysterious. Which do you go through? This will lead to the amazing adventure that will hopefully end with you leaving the cave with a great amount of treasure! Go through six caves, with different items, trying to find your way to that pot of money.
