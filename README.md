# FinalProject17
You are a piece of clothing. You have been transformed by God to this piece of clothing because he needs your help.
You are in a house filled with dirty clothing, and you are here to clean it all up. Battling dirty gushers and collecting tide pods,
you ar going to go to each room and get rid of the muck that infests this home!
